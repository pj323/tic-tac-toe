# Tic-Tac-Toe project

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project, a classic and timeless game brought to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! In this project, we've created an interactive and engaging version of Tic-Tac-Toe that offers two exciting game modes: "2 Players" and "vs Computer." Whether you want to challenge a friend or take on an AI opponent, this web-based game has got you covered.

With the "2 Players" mode, you can enjoy the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe experience, where Player 1 marks their moves with "X," and Player 2 counters with "O." Compete against a friend and prove your strategic prowess as you strive to achieve three in a row while avoiding your opponent's cunning moves.

If you're looking for a solo challenge, our "vs Computer" mode allows you to test your skills against an AI opponent. As Player 1, you play as "X," while the Computer takes on the role of Player 2, marked as "O." Can you outsmart the computer and secure a win, or will it outmaneuver you in this classic battle of wits?

This project provides a fun and interactive way to enjoy the game while honing your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Feel free to choose your preferred game mode and dive into the world of Tic-Tac-Toe!

- Two Exciting Game Modes:

2 Players Mode: Challenge a friend in a classic two-player game where Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
vs Computer Mode: Test your skills against an AI opponent as Player 1 ('X') while the Computer takes on the role of Player 2 ('O').
Interactive Game Board:

The game board is displayed on the web page, allowing players to click on cells to make their moves.
Player Instructions:

Clear instructions are provided to guide players on how to play the game.
In "2 Players" mode, the instructions indicate that Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
In "vs Computer" mode, it is mentioned that Player 1 is 'X' and the Computer is 'O'.

- Game Outcome Notifications:

Informative messages are displayed when the game concludes, including messages for wins, ties, and game restart options.
Randomized Computer Moves:

In "vs Computer" mode, the computer makes randomized moves to add an element of unpredictability.
Win Detection:

The game checks for winning conditions, including three-in-a-row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to declare a winner.

- Tie Detection:

The game checks for a tie when all cells on the board are filled without a winner.

- Restart Game Option:

Players can restart the game at any time using the "Restart Game" button.

- User Experience Enhancements:

The computer's move in "vs Computer" mode is delayed for a better user experience, providing clear separation between player and computer moves.
This project offers an engaging and interactive way to enjoy the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, catering to both multiplayer and solo players. Whether you want to challenge a friend or test your skills against a computer opponent, this web-based implementation of the game provides hours of entertainment and strategic thinking.
